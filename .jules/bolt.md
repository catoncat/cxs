## 2025-02-18 - Avoid array spreading inside double traversal
**Learning:** Found a performance bottleneck where `[...messages].reverse().find(...)` was used twice. This does unnecessary array allocations and double-pass array traversal.
**Action:** Replace multiple reverse searches by spreading array with a single reverse loop (`for (let i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--)`), which avoids array allocations completely and allows early returns in O(1) memory.
